# About Us

We are a social enterprise to help rural and tribal artisans of India to preserve their rich art & craft, and provide them a sustainable livelihood. It is a collective effort of artisans, designers and social activists to promote and revive the fast extinguishing art & craft of rural India. We also conduct training workshops for artisans from time to time to improve their skills in new designs as per the new emerging market demands. The income earned through this enterprise goes into improving the living standard and welfare of artisans and their families.
